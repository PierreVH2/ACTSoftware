Current bugs/notes:

ACQ - Pattern matching not working
ACQ - Images stored in actnew.ccd_img database table have negative start times
ACQ - Bright/faint scalers not really useful, change maths behind it


Revision 466 fixes:

ACQ - imgdisp widget gives incorrect RA
ACQ - Exposure time remaining occasionally negative


Revision 465 fixes:

ACQ - Exposure dialog now sized appropriately for its contents


# NOT ACQ

DTI - adjusting coordinates while tracking causes telescope to move off massively
In motor_driver/motor_intfce.c - change return value in start_goto when at target coordinates
Determine proper treatment of SuperWASP cloud data
act_environ - status light must remain red when weather data outdated
DTI - Remove status from widget_new functions, rather set initial values with DTI initial signals
DTI - Use finalise instead of destroy
TIME - check frequency of time messages
ENV - Moon RA, Dec incorrect
Change time, env, dti so set progstat_starting when time/env/coord messages not received for a while and update indicators accordingly
Add speed selection to DTI goto
act_environ - Wind speed incorrect
act_dti/domeshutter,dropout - button sensitivity incorrect (dropout open+close goes insensitive when domshutter manually opened)
motor_driver - does not stop tracking when act_dti disconnects
act_dti - auto target set when already at coordinates fails
Pointing model goes berserk at zenith
Should domeshutter close when programme exits/restarts?
Dome shutter does not close when DTI not running
Sched cancel does not work
DTI does not start tracking with auto target set
