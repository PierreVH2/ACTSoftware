act_dti does not get correct status_active (possibly act_environ is sending the wrong info?)
Once act_dti gets proper status_active, ensure that dome shutter open button is enabled
act_dti is not sending coordinates
Determine proper treatment of SuperWASP cloud data
Change act_environ wind direction display so only gives degrees
act_environ - degree symbol in sun alt, hour and degree symbols in moon ra, dec
act_environ - status light must remain red when weather data outdated
dti workout - check all componets operating as expected
dti - rearrange widgets - dome stuff in one block, instrument stuff in another, etc.
