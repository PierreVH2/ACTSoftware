Current bugs/notes:

ACQ - Pattern matching improving - all images seem to be offset by a few arcmin
ACQ - Add facility for on-screen markers
ACQ - Time left indicator freaks out when elapsed and waiting for image
ACQ - Imgdisp equatorial coordinates calculated relative to centre of image, not aperture centre
ACQ - Image points not within 0..360 in RA (possibly Dec also not in correct range)
ACQ - Double check RA, Dec GSC queries near borders


Revision 574 fixes:

acq_store.c - in function coord_constraint, test for proximity to boundary checked for ra_d_fk5~24.0, should be ra_d_fk5~360.0
acq_store.c - region lists were concatenated without comma-separators


Revision 573 fixes:

ACQ - Default target and user id were 0 (undefined), changed init for acq_objects struct in act_acq so these fields are initialised.


Revision 572 fixes:

ACQ - Images stored in actnew.ccd_img database table have negative start times
ACQ - IMGDISP RA, Dec display incorrect (probably due to recent switch from ra hours to ra deg in imgdisp)
ACQ - Changed how bright/faint scalers work


Revision 466 fixes:

ACQ - imgdisp widget gives incorrect RA
ACQ - Exposure time remaining occasionally negative


Revision 465 fixes:

ACQ - Exposure dialog now sized appropriately for its contents


# NOT ACQ

DTI - adjusting coordinates while tracking causes telescope to move off massively
In motor_driver/motor_intfce.c - change return value in start_goto when at target coordinates
Determine proper treatment of SuperWASP cloud data
act_environ - status light must remain red when weather data outdated
DTI - Remove status from widget_new functions, rather set initial values with DTI initial signals
DTI - Use finalise instead of destroy
TIME - check frequency of time messages
ENV - Moon RA, Dec incorrect
Change time, env, dti so set progstat_starting when time/env/coord messages not received for a while and update indicators accordingly
Add speed selection to DTI goto
act_environ - Wind speed incorrect
act_dti/domeshutter,dropout - button sensitivity incorrect (dropout open+close goes insensitive when domshutter manually opened)
motor_driver - does not stop tracking when act_dti disconnects
act_dti - auto target set when already at coordinates fails
Pointing model goes berserk at zenith
Should domeshutter close when programme exits/restarts?
Dome shutter does not close when DTI not running
Sched cancel does not work
DTI does not start tracking with auto target set
