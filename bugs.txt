Current bugs/notes:

DTI - adjusting coordinates while tracking causes telescope to move off massively
ACQ - Images never get correct coordinates, always get dummy coordinates
In motor_driver/motor_intfce.c - change return value in start_goto when at target coordinates
Determine proper treatment of SuperWASP cloud data
act_environ - status light must remain red when weather data outdated
DTI - Remove status from widget_new functions, rather set initial values with DTI initial signals
DTI - Use finalise instead of destroy
TIME - check frequency of time messages
ENV - Moon RA, Dec incorrect
Change time, env, dti so set progstat_starting when time/env/coord messages not received for a while and update indicators accordingly
Add speed selection to DTI goto
ACQ - figure out why it segfaults when it exits
act_environ - Wind speed incorrect
act_dti/domeshutter,dropout - button sensitivity incorrect (dropout open+close goes insensitive when domshutter manually opened)
motor_driver - does not stop tracking when act_dti disconnects
act_dti - auto target set when already at coordinates fails
Pointing model goes berserk at zenith
Should domeshutter close when programme exits/restarts?
Dome shutter does not close when DTI not running
Sched cancel does not work
DTI does not start tracking with auto target set



Changes revision 464

act_dti/domeshutter,dropout - fixed minor bug in blocking/unblocking button toggle event handlers (was (un)blocking open twice, instead of open once and close once)
motor_driver - move North/South in cardinal direction, tracking adjustment not done
act_dti/domeshutter - cannot open dome shutter
dti workout - check all componets operating as expected
  - Filters work
  - Apertures work
  - PMT Shutter works
  - Acqmir works
  - Focus works
  - EHT works
  - Telmove works
  - Domeshutter works
  - Dropout works
  - Telmove works
  - Dome rotation works
  - (Watchdog)
  - Trapdoor works
  - Main power works



Changes revision 463

MOTOR - When handset move to limit, emergency stop is activated
MOTOR - Handset emergency stop doesn't work and other problems with handset
MOTOR - Tested handset, few bugs encountered, all fine now
MOTOR - When starting/stopping motion, motor coordinates sometimes jumped - problem with send_steps, function was returning before IO operation complete, changed all inb and outb functions to inb_p and outb_p
MOTOR/DTI - Tested goto, encountered several bugs, all resolved
MOTOR/DTI - Tested cardinal move, encountered several bugs, all resolved
MOTOR - Ramp up/down needs to be faster - decreased check_motor period to 50 msec
MOTOR - Don't update coordinates when not init'd - when not init'd, motor driver gives fake (0) coordinates
Check motor handset move (and INIT) - mostly working
DTI/TELMOVE - Found and fixed bug, in check_button_sens, was checking for Southern limit where should have been checking for Western limit
ACQ - Removed unnecessary mysql.h include from act_imgdisp
ACQ - Changed message reporting backup data directory
ACQ - Fixed RA,dec display (RA East-West orientation was opposite to that of image)
